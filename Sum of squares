Prove that an integer n can be expressed as the sum of two squares iff 2n can be expressed as the sum of two squares

Solution:

Let x = a^2 + b^2 
    2x = 2(a^2 + b^2) = 2a^2 + 2b^2 = (a+b)^2 + (a-b)^2
    Conversely,
    2x = c^2 + d^2 
    Then c and d have the same parity.
    It follows that (c+d)/2 and (c-d)/2 are integers
    x = ((c+d)/2)^2 + ((c-d)/2)^2
