Each succeeding term is the sum of the cubes of the digits of the previous term. The first term is 2014. What is the 2014th term of the 
sequence?
( Appeared in 2014 PreRMO)

Solution:

We could attempt this computationally by writing an algorithm that gets the individual digits, cubes it and sums the so formed cubes and
generate the number.

However let us attempt it manually also. Maybe we will get a pattern.

If the first term is 2014 , then sum of cubes of individual digits = 2^3 + 0^3 + 1^3 + 4^3 = 73

Thus 73 is the second term

The third term after this is obviously 7^3 + 3^3 = 370

The fourth term is 3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 = 370 and the sequence just continues ad infinitum.

Therefore any term after this point is 370.

Hence the 2014th term is clearly 370.

Now the interesting thing is can a computer recognize the obvious pattern repeating and not compute the 2014th term and directly
conclude that the 2014th must be 370 only

What properties must be incorporated into the program for something to tell the computer this fact?

If 3 successive terms are equal then we can code this into the program and thats one way of telling the computer that any term after
this term must be 370.

But the instinctive reaction that a human would possess ( so called 'a ha moment') on seeing this, can a computer parallel this thought
process and that too without code written exclusively in order to do so.

That could be key challenge for AI.
