A 2X3 rectangle and a 3X4 rectangle are contained within a square without overlapping at any interior point, and the sides
of the square are parallel to the sides of the two given rectangles. What is the smallest possible area of the square?

Appeared in preRMO 2015

Solution:

As we have 2X3 rectangle and 3X4 rectangle non overlapping the size of the square cannot be less than 5
That is possible if 2X3 rectangle is adjacent to 3X4 rectangle, so minimum size of square is 5 and the area = 5X5 = 25
