A postman has to deliver five letters to five different houses. By accident, he posts one letter through each door without looking to 
see if it is the correct address. In how many different ways could he do this so that exactly two of the five houses receive the correct 
letters?

Solution:

Since exactly two of the five houses receive the correct letters, this can be done in 5   ways = 10 ways
                                                                                       C
                                                                                         2
Number of ways correct letters can be put in the right houses is 1 way only.

For the other 3 houses, if the correct order of the letters is (a,b,c) then all possible cases, where all 3 letters are placed wrong are,
(b,c,a) and (c,a,b) that is in 2 ways

Hence the number of ways letters are delivered correctly in 2 houses is 10 X 1 X 2 = 20 ways.
