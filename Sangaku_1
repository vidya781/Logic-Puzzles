This post will include 2 beautiful geometry problems that belong to the category of problems called as Temple Geometry dating to the Japanese cultures in the 18th and
19th centuries.

1] Miyagai Prefecture 1892

 A circle with centre O1 and radius r1 touches another circle, centre O2 and radius r2 externally.The two circles touch the line l at points A and B respectively.
 Show that AB^2 = 4r1r2
 
 Proof:
 
 As usual a neat geometric figure greatly simplifies our understanding of the problem
 
 Let P be the point of contact between the circles O1 and O2
 Therefore we must have O1-P-O2
 PO2 = r2
 PO1 = r1
 Now O1 O2 = O1P + PO2 = r1 + r2
 Draw O2M || to AB
 MABO2 forms a rectangle with l(MO2) = l(AB)
 O1M = O1A - MA = O1A - O2B (As MA = O2B)
 O1M = r1 - r2 ( As r1 > r2 )
 By Pythagoras Theorem on AO1MO2,
 (O1O2)^2 = (MO2)^2 + (O1M)^2
 (r1 + r2)^2 = (r1 - r2)^2 + (AB)^2
 => (AB)^2 = 4 r1r2 ( as desired)
 
 2] Gumma Prefecture 1824
 
 A circle with centre O3 touches the line l and the two tangent circles with centre O1, radius r1, and centre O2, radius r2
 
 Show that 1/sqrt(r3) = 1/sqrt(r1) + 1/sqrt(r2)
 
 Embed a circle O3 in the above figure with radius r3 so that it is sandwiched between these two bigger circles ( WLOG, r1 > r2 > r3)
 
 draw || lines O1A and O2B
 Let P be the point of contact of middle circle with line l
 
 M-O3-L || A-P_B
 ML = AB and MO3 = AP and O3L = PB
 O1O3 = r1 + r3
 O1M = O1A - MA = O1A - O3P = r1 - r3
 In Right Triangle O1MO3, (O1O3)^2 = (MO3)^2 + (O1M)^2
 (r1 + r2)^2 = (MO3)^2 + (r1-r3)^2
 (MO3)^2 = 4 r1 r3
 Similarly, (LO3)^2 = 4 r2 r3
 MO3 + LO3 = AP + PB = AB = 2 sqrt(r3)(sqrt(r1) + sqrt(r2))
 From the previous problem AB^2 = 4r1r2
 => AB = 2 sqrt(r1r2)
 => 2sqrt(r1r2) = 2sqrt(r3)[ sqrt(r1) + sqrt(r2)]
 Dividing throughout by sqrt(r1), sqrt(r2),sqrt(r3),
 we have 1/sqrt(r3) = 1/sqrt(r2) + 1/sqrt(r1)
