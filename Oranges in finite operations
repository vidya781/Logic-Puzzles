There are n>= 3 girls in a class sitting around a circular table each having some oranges with her. Every time, the teacher
notices a girl having more oranges than both of her neighbours combined, the teacher takes away one orange from that girl and
gives one orange each to her neighbours. Prove that this process stops after a finite number of steps( Assume that the 
teacher has an abundant supply of oranges)

Solution:

Let p(i) be the number of oranges with the i th girl
Consider a seating arrangement in the clockwise direction with 0 th girl, 1st girl ,   ith girl , till the n th gile
finally the 0th girl again.

S = a finite number = |p0-p1| + |p1-p2| +.....+ |pn-p0|
If i th girl 's oranges are changed by this operation, we
have : | p(i-2)-p(i-1)| can change by +/- 1
       | p(i+1)-p(i+2)| can change by +/- 1
       | p(i-1)-p(i)| and |p(i)-p(i+1)| both decreases by 2
       ( proved by actually plugging in numbers)
       as p(i) > p(i-1) and p(i+1)
       So, S decreases with every operation
But S>= 0 => process will end in a finite number of steps
