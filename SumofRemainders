Digits of positive integer n are 4 consecutive integers in decreasing order when read from left to right.
Sum of possible Remainders when n is divided by 37?

Appeared in PreRMO 2015

Solution:

We are given 4 consecutive integers that constitute the number. The smallest 4 digit number is 3210
hence if 3210 is divided by 37, remainder is 28

if 1111 is added to 3210 we get 4321, the next higher number with the constraint.

When 4321 is divided by 37, remainder is 29 ( 28 + 1 )

There are 7 such numbers with 1st digit from 3 to 9

Highest such number = 9876
Remainder when divided by 37 = 34

So the sum of the remainders = 34 + 33 + 32 + 31 + 30 + 29 + 28 = 217
