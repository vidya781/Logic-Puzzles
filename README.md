# Logic-Puzzles
Puzzles of all kinds

Some of the puzzles that appear here are from the late  Martin Gardner's books ( one of the world's greatest puzzlers) while some are from Professor Dennis Shasha's works on puzzles and problem solving.

The solutions that are here are entirely my own. Of course alternate solutions may exist and you are free to verify them on your own.
