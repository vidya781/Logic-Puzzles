P is randomly chosen point in a unit square. Connect P with the vertices of the base. Find the probability that the triangle
is acute angled.

This wonderful problem appeared in PreRMO 2018.

Solution:

In this case, there are three possibilities:
a) The formed triangle is acute angled
b) The formed triangle is right angled
c) The formed triangle is obtuse angled

It is again vital to draw a neat figure with DC as the base of the semicircle so that going anticlockwise direction
DCBA is the square and diagonals AC and BD intersect at O. Let the side of the square be a.

All the points ON the semicircle DOC will give rise to right angled triangles when joined to the base vertices D and C.

All the points inside the semicircle DOC will give rise to obtuse angled triangles when joined to the base vertices D and C.

All points, outside the semicircle DOC , ie in the area ABCOD, will give rise to acute angled triangle when joined to D and C.

We use the area for finding the required probability.

Area of the square is a^2.
So, area of the region ABCOD where the point P will form an acute angled triangle
     = a^2 - Pi(a/2)^2 x (1/2) = a^2 - pi (a^2/8)
     
Therefore possibility that triangle PDC will be acute angled = [a^2-(pi.a^2/8)]/a^2 = 17/28
