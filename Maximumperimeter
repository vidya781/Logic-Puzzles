In a triangle with integer side lengths, one side is three times as long as a second side, and the length of the third side is 17.
What is the greatest possible perimeter of the triangle?

This one appeared in PreRMO 2014.

Solution:

Let ABC be the traingle with a = 17, b and c being the other two sides.

b/c = 3 ( by definition)

17 + b > c
=> 17 + 3c > c So c = 1,2,...but this gives little to no information on the bound
as we get 17 + 2c > 0

b + c > a
3c + c > 17
4c > 17
Therefore min value c can take = 5

If c = 5, b = 15

Also a + c > b
==> 17 + c > 3c
==> 17 > 2c
Therefore we have an upper bound on c, c(max) = 8
Hence b = 3(8) = 24
Perimeter P(max) = 24 + 8 + 17 = 49

Here in this problem, it was vital to see the upper and lower bounds and get one side of the triangle in between this range. The allowable
values of the other sides follow suit as per definition and given information.
