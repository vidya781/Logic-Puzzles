On the average, how many times must a die be thrown until one gets a 6?

Solution:

Assuming a fair die, seems intutive to guess that at least 6 times, the die must be thrown to get a 6
and this is the worst case scenario.
Let p be the probability of a 6 on a given trial. Then the probabilities of success for the first time 
on each trial are ( q = 1-p)

Trial     Probability of success on trial
------    --------------------------------
1                p
2                pq
3                pq^2
.                .
.                .
.                .
The sum of the probabilities is : p + pq + pq^2 + ....
                                 = p(1 + q + q^2 + ....) = p/(1-q) = 1
                                 
The mean number of trials, m , is by definition :
      m = p + 2pq + 3pq^2 + 4pq^3 +.....
      
  In order to sum a geometric - arithmetico progression we have
      qm =      pq + 2pq^2 + 3pq^3 + ......
      
      => m - qm = p + pq + pq^2 + .....
      => m(1-q) = 1
      Consequently, mp = 1 and m = 1/p, now p = 1/6 and so m = 6
      
  It is very interesting to note that when the first toss is a failure, the mean number of tosses is 1+m 
  and when the first toss is a success, the mean number is 1. Then m = p(1) + q(1+m) and so m = 1/p
