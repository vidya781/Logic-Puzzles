Each of the numbers x1,x2,...xn is either +1 or -1
If S = x1x2x3x4 + x2x3x4x5 + x3x4x5x6 +.....xnx1x2x3 = 0
Prove that n is a multiple of 4

This problem is off Engl.

Solution :

Each xi is either 0 or -1, each term x(a) x(a+1)x(a+2)x(a+3) is also either +1 or -1
Sum of n terms = 0 , => there must be some terms that are +1 and some terms which are -1 so that the resultant is 0
We can say that (n/2) terms have sum 1, and (n/2) terms sum of -1

Suppose that p of the x(i)'s are +1 
Since each x(i) occurs in 4 of the terms x(a)x(a+1)x(a+2)x(a+3) there will be a total of 4p occurences of a factor x(i) = +1 
throughout S
Each term that is equal to +1 will contain even number of factors x(i) = +1 and each term which is -1 will contain an
odd number of them.

4p = ( Sum of n/2 even integers)+ (sum of n/2 odd integers)
Since any sum of even integers is even, and the total of 4p is even, it follows that sum of n/2 odd integers is even.
But sum of a collection of odd integers is even only when there ois an even number of them.
Hence (n/2) must be even making n to be a multiple of 4.
