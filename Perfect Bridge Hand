Adapted from Mosteler:

We often read of someone who has been dealt 13 spades at bridge. With a well-shuffled pack of cards, what is the chance 
that you are dealt with a perfect hand ( 13 of one suit ) ? ( Bridge is played with an ordinary pack of 52 cards, 13 in
each of 4 suits and each of 4 players is dealt 13 )

Solution:

Since the cards are well shuffled we might take 13 cards of one suit from the top of the pack. 
Start with any card and thereafter one is restricted to the same suit.

So the number of ways to be dealt 13 of one suit is :

52 X 12 X 11 X 10 X 9 X 8 X 7 X 6 X 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1 = 52 X 12 !

How does one get the total number of ways to obtain a bridge hand?

52 X 51 X 50.....42 X 41 X 40 = 52 !/ 39 !

The correct probability is then : 52 X 12!/(52!/39!) = 12 ! 39 !/ 51 !

A different approach to compute this probability is as follows :

Approach of binomial coefficients. They count the number of different ways to arrange a elements of one kind and b elements 
of another in a row. For example, 3 a's and 2 b's can be arranged in 10 ways . Start with aaabb and end with bbaaa eventually.
The Binomial coefficient is 5 
                             C.  meaning the number of ways to arrange 5 things, 2 of one kind, 3 of another.
                              2 
 Numerical value is given in terms of factorials : 5 
                                                     C.   =   5 !/ 2 ! 3 ! = 5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1/ 2 X 1 X 3 X 2 X 1 = 10
                                                       2
 Generalising, with n things , a of one kind, and n - a of another, the number of arrangements is n ! / a! (n-a)! 
 
 The number of ways to choose 13 cards = 52 !/ 13 ! 39 !
 The number of ways to get 13 spades is 1 way ( if we want the whole set ) 
 We have 4 suits and so we multiply by 4 to get 4 X 13 ! 39 !/52 ! and this corroborates with the previous method as well.
                                                 = 12 ! 39 !/ 51 !
