Three non-collinear points are given in a plane.How many straight lines can be drawn in a plane, which are equidistant from
all three points?

Solution:

Let's first construct a scenario wherein we move from the collinear points to the non collinear points. Take a straight line with
3 points on this line. When visualising how many lines are equidistant to these 3 points, we note that the line divides the plane
into two equal halves and we could have 1 line at a distance d from the existing line L. We could treat the line L as a mirror 
and draw another line at the same distance d but on the opposite side ( treat this as the mirror image of the first line that you have
drawn. You could draw one more line at d' > d and draw its mirror image on the opposite side of L. Thus you could continue this
process forever and so technically you will have infinite lines in this case when the points are collinear. Now we move to the
non collinear points scenario. Take 2 points as constructing a line and a third point at a distance away so as to form an acute
angled triangle.

Draw a perpendicular from the third point to the line you have drawn with the 2 collinear points (this satisfies the non 
collinearity property).Now draw a line parallel to the line which joins the two points and cutting the line joining the 
third point perpendicularly. This new parallel line is equidistant to the two points on a line as well as the third point.
This is for one configuration. Any other configuration will not yield equidistant lines from the three points, so the said line 
has to be in between the 3 points.

We can have 2 more configurations similar to the above where we form the straight line in 2 more ways for the remaining points
and keep the third point in the plane. Then in each of these cases, we will be having one line in between that will be equidistant 
to the isolated point and the line by cutting the perpendicular from the point to the line in half.

Thus the total number of such lines is easily seen to be 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

There are 3 such lines which are equidistant from all the three points.
