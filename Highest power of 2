Determine the highest power of 2 dividing 2^n!

From Hungarian Contest Problems III ( Andy Liu)

Solution
--------

Note that 2^1 ! = 2, 2^2 != 24, 2^3! = 40320
        
Conjecture that 2^n - 1 is the highest power

Using induction : for n >= 3, highest power of 2 that divides 2^n! is 2^n - 1
Highest power of 2 that divides (2^n-1)! is 2^n - 1 - n
Consider 2^(n+1) !

Line the 2^(n+1) factors in the two rows as follows:

1.        2.        3     .... |.  2^n
-------------------------------
2^n+1    2^n + 2   2^n + 3 .....| 2^(n+1)

By induction hypotheses, the highest power of 2 that divides the product of numbers in the 
first row is 2^n - 1 by induction hypotheses
For 1<=k < 2^n, a power of 2 divides k iff it divides 2^n + k . This follows from the distributivity theorem since
such a power of 2 must divide 2^n

In each column except the last, the highest power of 2 that divides the number in the first row is the same as that 
dividing the number in the second row. In the last column, the highest power of 2 dividing the number in the first row
is 1 less than that dividing the number in the second row. 
Hence the highest power of 2 that divides 2^(n+1)! is 2(2^n-1) + 1 = 2^(n+1) - 1
