This puzzle has a probabilistic shade to it. Which one is more likely?  Exactly 3 heads in 4 tosses or exactly 5 heads in 8 
tosses?

Solution:

We note that the total number of different combinations that can result in 4 tosses is 2 ^ 4 = 16 [In case this is not apparent
please see that each toss can result in heads or tails both of which are equally likely.]

Exactly 3 heads can occur in 4  ways = 4 different ways.
                              C
                               3
So probability P(Case 1) = 4 / 16 = 1/4


Following a similar approach we have P(Case 2) = 8              = 56 / 256 = 7 / 32
                                                  C
                                                    5 / 2 ^ 8 
                               
Mathematically we note that 1/4 > 7/32 or 32 > 28. So P(Case 1) > P(Case 2).So we get the result that 3 heads in 4 tosses in a 
fair coin is more likely than 5 heads in 8 tosses. This may appear counter intuitive at first but thats how the numbers play out.
