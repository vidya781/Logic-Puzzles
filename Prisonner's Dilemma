Three prisoners A,B and C with apparently equally good records have applied for parole.The parole board has decided to 
release two of the three, and the prisoners know this but not which two. A warder friend of prisoner A knows who are to 
be released. Prisoner A realizes that it would be unethical to ask the warder if he, A, is to be released, but thinks of 
asking for the name of one prisoner other than himself who is to be released.He thinks that before he asks, his chances of 
release are 2/3. He thinks that if the warder says "B will be released", his own chances have now gone down to 1/2, because 
either A and B, or B and C are to be released. And so A decides not to reduce his chances by asking. However A is mistaken
in his calculations.Explain.

Solution:

A is mistaken in that he has not listed out the events properly. That is, the correct sample space is lacking.

Possibilities of release:

1) A B
2) A C
3) B C

Let us consider sequentially: P(Ar) = 2/3 and P(Br) = 1/2 after A has got released. C in prison
Therefore P(Ar)P(Br) = P(E1) = 1/3 that AB are out of prison

Similarly P(E2) = 1/3 that AC are out of prison 

This is mainly because of the fact that A feels that he will surely be released and hence P(Ar) in both cases = 2/3

But consider B , P(Br) = 1/3 and P(Cr) = 1/2, P(E3) = P(Br)P(Cr) = 1/6

A conducts a thought experiment in which he feels that the warder might say B
Now we consider some possibilities :

1]A and B released and warder says B, probability = 1/3
2] A and C released and warder says C, probability = 1/3
3] B and C released and warder says B, probability = 1/6
4] B and C released and warder says C, probability = 1/6

If, in response to A's question , warder says "B will be released",then the probability for A's release is probability from 1]
divided by sum of probabilities from 1] and 3] ( which in both cases B is released)
Thus the probability of A's release is 1/3/(1/3 + 1/6) = 2/3
Thus because of the warder's response, his probability of being released will not be lessened
