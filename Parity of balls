1983 Australian Olympiad.

In a large urn there are 75 white balls and 150 black ones and beside the urn is a big pile of black balls. The following
two step operation is performed repeatedly. Firstly two balls are withdrawn at random from the urn and then:

a] If they are both black, one of them is put back and the other is thrown away
b] If one is black and the other white, the white one is put back and the black one is thrown away
c] If they are both white, they are both thrown away and a black ball from the pile is put into the urn

Therefore whatever the case, at each stage two balls are removed from the urn and only one is put back thur reducing the 
number of balls in the urn by one. Eventually the urn will reach the point of containing just a single ball. The question is
" What color is this last ball? "

Solution:

Randomly mix up the operations and see what teh result is for the first few moves:
                B.   W.   B.   W.   B.   W.  B.    W.   B.   W.   B.   W
a a b b c c ---149 + 75, 148 + 75, 147 + 75, 146 + 75, 147 + 73, 148 + 71

a b b a c a ---149 + 75, 148 + 75, 147 + 75, 146 + 75, 147 + 73, 146 + 73

c c b a c b --- 151 + 73, 152 + 71, 151 + 71, 150 + 71, 151 + 69, 150 + 69

These are a series of 6 operations that we did on the balls in the urn.
What pattern do we see?
Note that the number of white balls is always odd, whereas the number of black balls fluctuates between odd and even 
depending on the operation defined.
We cannot say anything concrete about the number of black balls as the number of balls steadily decreases. There might be some
white balls around when the number of black balls decreases to one, but the number of white balls provide a valuable insight.

Parity of the white balls is always the same no matter the operation. One starts with an odd number of white balls , namely 
75 and it must remain odd all throughout.. this means that the urn will always contain one white ball all throughout.Therefore
the last ball will always be white since in every move we take 2 balls. Au contraire, if the number of white balls at the very
beginning had been even, it would be impossible to wind up with a single white ball ( an odd number ) implying that the last 
ball would be black.
