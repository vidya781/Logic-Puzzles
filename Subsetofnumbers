A subset B of the set of first 100 positive numbers has the property that no two elements of B sum to 125

What are the maximum number of elements in B?

Solution:

Choose 62 numbers so that the sum of any two cannot be 125

If the numbers from 1,2,3....62 are put in a set { 1,2,...62} then 62 + 61 = 123
If 63 is included in this set then {1,2....,62,63} then 63 + 62 = 125 so its clear that 63 cannot be included in this set.

In case we choose 50 even numbers, 2 to 100 then the set becomes { 2,4,6,8,10,.....100 }
We cannot choose 13 odd numbers in the subset as one of them > = 25 implies that sum > 125

Choosing 50 odd numbers and putting them in one set { 1,3,5,....99 } and in the subset B choose one even number >= 26 as 99 +
26 = 125

So maximum number of elements = 62

Thus we cannot have 63 elements and hence the maximum number of elements = 62
