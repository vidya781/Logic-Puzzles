Let f be a one-to-one function from the set of natural numbers to itself such that f(mn) = f(m)f(n) for all natural numbers m and n.
What is the least possible value of f(999)?

Appeared in PreRMO 2014

Solution:

We first note that 999 = 3^3 X 37 thus revealing the primes that constitute it.

Define for each prime p f(p) = q where q is a number and q is also a prime

But can q be 1?

f(p^2) = f(p) = 1 and the values are no longer unqiue as per definition

So f(999) = f(3^3 X 37) = f(3)^3 X f(37)

This is lowest when we define f(3) < f(37) and they are as low as possible.

So define f(3) = 2 and f(37) = 3 giving f(999) = 24 as the lowest possible value.
