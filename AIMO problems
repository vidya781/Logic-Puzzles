1) Let ABCD be a parallelogram and let P be a point inside it such that < APB + < CPD = 180
   Prove that < PBC = < CDP
   
   Solution :
   
   Draw a parallelogram in which AB || DC and AD || BC
   P be the point inside where <APB + <CPD = 180
   Let < APB = a, <DPC = b
   to prove < CDP = < PBC = T
   Now T + b + < PCD = 180
   => < PCD = 180-(T+b) = <CAB
   Also, 180-(T+b) + T + a = 180
   a = b
   Therefore a + a = 180 ( as a = b)
   a = 90
   Therefore the parallelogram is either a rectangle or a square
   But since the diagonals intersect each other at right angles, the parallelogram transforms 
   into a square and hence we must have ABCD is a square
   d = s
   => < CDP = < CBP ( proved )
   
   2) A semicircle, centre O, is inscribed in quad ABCD so that AB contains the diameter and BC
      CD and DA are all tangents to the semicircle and AO = OB. Prove that AO^2 = AD.BC
      
     Solution:
     
     Draw a figure in which AB is diamter and O is the centre so that AO = OB
     
     AD, BC are tangents at extremities and DC touches the semicircle at M. Draw OM
     Clearly (2r)^2 = AM^2 + MB^2
     Now AM = 2dcos(a), MB = 2dcos(b)
     
     where AD = d = DM and l = BC = CM
     a = <DAK and b = <CBN where N is mid point of MB
     
     r^2 = d^2cos^2(a) + l^2cos^2(b)
     
     By similarity of T(AOM) and T(BOM)
     AO/AM = BO/BM
     dcos(a) = lcos(b)
     r^2 = 2l^2cos^2(b)
     => cos(b) = r/l sqrt(2)
     also cos(a) = r/d sqrt(2)
     => r^2 = 2dlcos(a)cos(b)
     From symmetry, a = b = 45
     => r^2 = 2dl (1/sqrt(2) ) (1/sqrt(2))
     => r^2 = dl
     Hence AO^2 = AD.BC
     
     3] T(ABC) is acute angled Triangle with AB = 15 and AC = 13 and let D be the foot of the 
        perpendicular from A to BC and area(ADC) = 30. If the area of T(ADC) is an integer, what is it?
        
     Solution :
     
     Draw a neat figure to simplify, then AD is the altitude to BC
     DC = sqrt(169-h^2)
     BD = sqrt(225-h^2)
     
     A(ABC) = h/2 [ DC + BD]
     We are given h sqrt(169-h^2) = 60 
                                  = 12 X 5
                                  = 6 X 10. ( ignoring others like 15 X 4, 30 X 2) etc as h must be less 
                                  than 13 and 15
     Let h = 12 then h^2 = 144, DC = sqrt(169-144) = 5 and BD = 9
     Therefore A = 1/2 X 14 X 12 = 84
