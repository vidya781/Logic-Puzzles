In Triangle ABC, we have AC = BC = 7 and AB = 2. Suppose that D is a point on line AB such that B lies between A and D and CD = 8.
Find the length of segment BD.

Appeared in RMO 2012.

Solution:

By applying the traingle constraints firstly and labelling BD as x, we have that x + 3 >= 0 and 13 >= x and combining these two
0 <= x + 3 <= 16 

Let M be the base of the perpendicular from C to AB. Since the triangle is isosceles , AM = MB = 1 and by application of pythagorean 
theorem for traingle AMC, MC = 4 sqrt(3) and CM^2 = 16.

By application of Pythagoras theorem to traingle CMD, (x + 1)^2 + 48 = 64
Therefore (x+1) = 4 and thus x = 3 satisfying the constraint that 0 <= 3 + 3 <= 16.
