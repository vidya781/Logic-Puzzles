One morning, each member of my family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee and milk. The amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to
cup, but they were never zero. I drank 1/7th of the total amount of milk and 2/17th of the total amount of coffee. The question is:

How many people are there in my family?

Solution:

This puzzle appeared in a preRMO. 

The first thing to note is that there is a 7 in the denominator of the total amount of milk, so the entire amount must be of the form 7A.

Amount of coffee, likewise must be of the form 17B.

Therefore ratio of the amount of milk and coffee drank by me to that of the total milk and coffee = ( A + 2B )/(7A + 17B)

Now, ratio is always of the form 1/n, where n is the number of people in the family.

So, (7A + 17B)/(A + 2B) should be an integer

(7A + 17B)/(A + 2B) = (7A + 14B + 3B)/(A + 2B) = 7 + 3B/(A + 2B)

In 3B/(A + 2B) , as A is a natural number, 0 < 3B/(A + 2B) < 3/2

Again, as 3B/(A + 2B) is an integer value, the only possible integer here is 1.

Hence the number of people in the family = n = 7 + (3B/(A+2B)) = 7 + 1 = 8
