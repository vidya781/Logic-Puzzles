In a class, the total number of boys and girls are in the ratio 4:3. On one day it was found that 8 boys and 14 girls
were absent from the class, and that the number of boys was the square of the number of girls. What is the total number
of students in the class?

Solution:

We formulate the equations thus: 
Let the number of boys = 4x
Number of girls = 3x
We are given that 4x - 8 = (3x - 14)^2
=> 4x - 8 = (3x - 14)^2
=> 4x - 8 = 9x^2 - 84x + 196
=> 9x^2 - 88x + 204 = 0
=> (x - 6)(9x - 34) = 0
=> x = 6
Total number of students = 7x = 42
