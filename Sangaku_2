ABCD is a square of side a, and M is the centre of a circle with diameter AB; CA and DB are arcs of circles of radius a and centres D and C respectively.
Find the radius r1, of the circle, centre O, inscribed in the area common to these circles. Find also the radius r2 of the circle, centre O' which touches 
CA and DB externally.

Solution:

As a first step draw a neat diagram to illustrate the points

AB = a, OP1 = r1, O'Q = r2
Now in the same diagram draw OP which represents the radius r1 caused by the DB and extend it all the way to c so 
we have P-O-C
Now through O draw a line || to AD ( or BC) so as to get M-O-N
N lies on DC
Since the centres of the two circles lie on one line itself, N-O-O'-M
From the centre O] mark a point Q on the circle which has radius r2 and Q lies on arc BD as well.
Extend Q all the way to C so that O'-O-C

In T(ONC) which is right angled, ON^2 + NC^2 = OC^2
Now AB = CD = a and ND = CN = a/2 as N is the midpoint of CD
If a semicircle were drawn with CD as diameter it would touch the other semicircle already present
Therefore if the contact point were to be marked as L , we have N-L-O
But NL = CN = DN = a/2
Therefore NO = NL + LO = a/2 + r1
Applying Pythagoras theorem to T(ONC), we have
(a/2 + r1) ^2 + (a/2)^2 = (a-r1)^2. ( As ON^2 + NC^2 = OC^2)
( CP = a = radius CD of the larger circle  and CP = CO + OP as C-O-P, CO = a-r1)
=> a^2/4 + ar1 + r1^2 + a^2/4 = a^2-2ar1 + r1^2
=> 3ar1 = a^2/2
=> r1 = a/6

Now in T(O'NC),
O'N^2 + NC^2 = O'C^2
NM = a 
O'N = NM - O'M = a - r2
and O'C = CQ + O'Q = a + r2
Applying Pythagoras theorem to T(O'NC)
O'N^2 + NC^2 = O'C^2 
=> (a-r2)^2 + (a/2)^2 = (a + r2)^2
=> a^2 - 2ar2 + r2^2 + a^2/4 = a^2 + 2ar2 + r2^2
=> 4ar2 = a^2/4
=> r2 = a/16

Thus r1 = a/6 and r2 = a/16 with r1 > r2

ABCD is a rectangle with AB = sqrt(2) BC. Semicircles are drawn with AB and CD as the diameters.
The circle that touches AB and CD passes through the intersection of these semicircles. Find the area S of each lune in terms of AB


Now DG = GE = radius of semicircle, DG = GE = asqrt(2)/2
Now EF subtends a right angle at G, < EGF = 90
EG^2 + GF^2 = EF^2
(a sqrt(2)/2)^2 + (a sqrt(2)/2)^2 = EF^2
=> EF^2 = a^2 , EF = a
To find the area of each lune,
< EGH = 90 ( angle in semicircle)
Area of segment EHF = Area of sector GEHF ( where H is the mid point on the arc of semicircle with CD as diameter) - Area T(EFG)
       = Theta/2 (r)^2 - [ 1/2 X asqrt(2)/2 X asqrt(2)/2)] = Pi/4 (a sqrt(2)/2)^2 - a^2/4. ---- (1)
       
 Area of each lune (S) = Area of semicircle on EF - Area of segment EHF
                       = 1/2 Pi ( a/2)^2 - [ Pi/4 (a sqrt(2)/2)^2 - a^2/4 ] = a^2/4 = AB^2/8  ( from (1) )
                       
 Joint area of the lunes = 2 ( AB ) ^2 / 8 = (AB) ^ 2/4.   
 
 Note that the answer is independent of Pi.Hippocrates is also said to have investigated lunes and has shown that it was possible to square the
 region between the two circles.
