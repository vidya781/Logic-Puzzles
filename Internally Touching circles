Two circles are internally tangent at point T. A chord AB of the outer circle touches the inner circle at the point P.
Prove that TP always bisects < ATB.

Solution:

Let AB extended meet the common tangent at Q and let the angles <ATP = x, <PTB = y, <BTQ = z

Now as always, it is instructive to tackle geometric problems with a neat diagram.

QT and QP are equal tangents to the inner circle making triangle TQP isosceles and w = y + z
With regard to the outer circle, TQ is a tangent and TB is a chord; thus the angle z between then is equal to the angle in the
segment on the other side of the chord, that is 
z = < A
Now, exterior angle w of T(APT) = sum of the interior remote angles and so w = x + < A = x + z
Hence w = y + z = x + x, giving y = x and hence TP always bisects <ATB
