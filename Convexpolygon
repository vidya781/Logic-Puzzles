A convex polygon has its interior angles in arithmetic progression, the least angle being 120 and the common difference
being 5 degrees. Find the number of sides of the polygon.

Solution

Given A.P is 120,125,130...the sum of interior angles of a polygon = (n-2)180
Hence sum of n terms of AP = n/2[2.120 + (n-1).5)=180(n-2) 
=> n = 9,16
But if n = 16, then 16th angle = 120 + 15.5 = 195 > 180 which is not possible and hence n = 9
