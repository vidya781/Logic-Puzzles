A contractor has two teams A and B. Team A can complete a job in 12 days and team B can do the same job in 36 days. 
Team A starts working on the job and team B joins team A after 4 days. The team A withdraws after two more days. For how many
more days should team B work to complete the job?

Solution:

We formulate some equations immediately: Team A speed = W/12 = a 
Team B speed = W/36 = b 

Let n days more be needed to complete the work:

4a + 2(a+b) + bn = W . where W is the total work to be completed and the symbols have their meanings as defined above
6a + b(n+2) = W
=> 6W/12 + (n+2)W/36 = W
=> [18W + (n+2)W]/36 = W
=> 18 + (n+2) = 36
=> n = 16
Therefore 16 more days would be required by Team B to complete the job working after Team A withdraws.
