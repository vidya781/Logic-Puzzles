This problem originally appeared in HMO 1974 and is attributed to Erdos.

Two nonoverlapping squares of sides a and b are placed inside a square of side 1. Prove that a + b <= 1

Solution:

We consider various configurations : Non overlapping means our possibilities get restricted within the space enclosed 
by the square. 

They can touch each other or not touch. Since they both are inside the square at any arbitrary location , if they do not 
touch each other, we can choose a and b, arbitrarily small and varied so that a + b is always < 1

We can set up a coordinate system such that the main square is defined as follows : O(0,0), A(1,0),B(1,1) and C(0,1)

If the two squares are contiguous and touch each other externally, then we must have s1 + s2 = 1 in the case that the sides
of the squares are along the length of the main square and constitute it wholly. In such a scenario, a + b = 1 clearly.

Consider a different configuration : along the diagonals. If the squares touch each other along the diagonals, and constitute
it wholly, we have a.sqrt(2) + b.sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) , => a + b = 1

This is the scenario in case of orientation along either diagonal and is the extreme case.

The final case comes from the diamond configuration along the X or the Y axis.
In this case also because the squares touch at a single point in the diamond config, the diagonals are a.sqrt(2) and b.sqrt(2)
and we must have a.sqrt(2) + b.sqrt(2) = 1
In this case, a + b = 0.707 < 1

Therefore in consideration of all cases, we can infer that a + b <= 1
