An example of a simple wordplay:

Let Akbar and Birbal together have n marbles, where n > 0

Akbar says to Birbal , " If I give you some marbles then you will have twice as many marbles as I will have. " Birbal says to Akbar,
" If I give you some marbles then you will have thrice as many marbles as I will have. "

What is the minimum possible value of n for which the above statements are true?


Solution:

We could straightaway take an equation based approach to solve this problem, a simple word play. But the trick here is not to jump into
equations but rather analyze the wordplay a little deeper.

When the first statement terminates, Birbal should have a minimum of 2 and Akbar should have a minimum of 1 marble.

So for now between them they have a total of 3 marbles.

Consider now the second statement: When the second statement terminates, Akbar should have a minimum of 3 and Birbal should have  a
minimum of 1 marble.

So, now we have a total of 4 marbles minimum in this case.

Now, in order to find the minimum possible number 'n', which satisfies both the above cases, we need to take the LCM of 3 and 4
which gives us 12.

Hence, the required n = 12.

An equation based approach:

x + y = n -----(1) 

where x = initial number of marbles with Akbar and y = initial number of marbles with Birbal
Total = n 

At the end of Akbar's statement : y + l / x - l = 2  where l is the number of marbles that Akbar gives Birbal

2x - y = 3l -----(2)

Now there is a subtlety of interpretation here:

We formulate 2 scenarios:

1) If Birbal were to give some marbles initially from what he had
2) If Birbal were to give marbles after receiving marbles from Akbar

We check for internal consistency in both cases:

1] x + k / y - k = 3
   4k = 3y - x  where k is the number of marbles that Birbal gives Akbar
   4k = 3y - x -------(3)
   
   and on simplifying (2) and (3) we get 5y = (8k + 3l)
     y = (8k + 3l)/5
     Now we know that y has to be an integer < n
     Plugging in some values for k and l , we hit upon k = 2 and l = 3 to yield y = 5 marbles.
     
     Also if we try k = 3 and l = 2, we get y = 6 marbles . At this point we have no way of knowing if Akbar or Birbal has
     more marbles. 
     
  If we go by the premise that k = 2 and l = 3 it means that definitely akbar must have more than 3 marbles ( as per 1st statement)
  and birbal must have more than 2 marbles so total number of marbles must be more than 5.
  
  If we go by the premise that k = 3 and l = 2 we get y = 6 so total number of marbles must definitely be more than 6 marbles.
  
  x + 5 = n ==> x = n - 5 ( k = 2, l = 3)
  
  x + 6 = n ===> x = n - 6 (k = 3, l = 2)
  
  Both these are valid possibilities. But we need the minimum number of marbles in the initial case.
  
  Notice the unique pattern that has emerged in these cases ( k = 2, l = 3) and
                                                            ( k = 3, l = 2)
   So the total number has to be some multiple of the above pattern for supposedly both cases to hold good. One possibility from the
   LCM point of view is 6. So if n = 6, lets re formulate the original hypotheses.
   
   Akbar and Birbal have 6 marbles in total: Akbar gives 3 , so Akbar must have had more than 3 marbles which is an absurdity as if
   he gives away these marbles he would be left with none at all and the first statement is void.
   
   So we go in for the next LCM which is 12 and now all statements would be valid if this were true.
   
   So the minimum number of marbles between them must be 12.( using diophantine equations and simple logic based arguments)
   
  -------
  Now what happens if :
  2]  If Birbal were to give marbles after receiving marbles from Akbar
  
  x + y = n ( Initially)
  Let Akbar give l marbles to Birbal
  Therefore Akbar now has: (x-l) marbles
  Birbal has (y+l) marbles.
  Then by the first statement (y+l)/(x-l) = 2 
  ==> y + l = 2(x-l)
  ==> 2x - y = 3l  -----(4)
  
  Now as per the second statement at this point: Birbal has y+l marbles and he now gives k marbles to Akbar
  Therefore Akbar now has : ( x - l) + k and Birbal has ( y + l) - k
  
  (x-l) + k / (y + l)-k = 3
  ==> x - 3y = 4(l-k)----(5)
  
  Solving for both (4) and (5) we get y = 8(k) - 5(l) / 5 wherein y = (8/5) * k - l
  
  For y to be a positive integer, k has to be a multiple of 5 ( 5, 10, 15....) so definitely Birbal must have had more than 5 marbles.
  
  and also l < (8/5) * k if k = 5
           l < 8 { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
           
  Thus in order to determine the minimum number, if we go by the premise that Birbal has given 5 marbles to Akbar ( k = 5)
  Birbal must have had ( y + l) - 5 and Akbar must have had (x-l) + 5 marbles.
  
  Now assuming 'some marbles' implies a minimum of 2 marbles, we can take l = 2 as it satisfies l < 8 ( another possibility is l = 7)
  
  k = 5 and l = 2 ( LCM of these is 10)
  k = 5 and l = 3 (LCM of these is 15)
  k = 5 and l = 4 (LCM of these is 20)
  k = 5 and l = 5 (LCM of these is 25) ( but this would imply the exchange of marbles is the same: Akbar gives 5, Birbal gives 5
  which may not really be true as no real exchange has taken place)
  k = 5 and l = 6 (LCM of these is 30)
  k = 5 and l = 7 (LCM of these is 35)
  
  So if we have worded the problem clearly, the minimum number in this case becomes 10 and in the next higher case it is 15.
  So in all likelihood, if someone came up with the minimum number of marbles as 15, the ambiguity ( or the interpretation) embedded 
  therein is taken care of as in the previous case 14 < 15.
  
  A case in point to show that the solution to a problem depends on one's cognitive interpretation of the problem and as long as one
  states the hypotheses and the assumptions clearly, and the arguments justified, they are all valid propositions.
