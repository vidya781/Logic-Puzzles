For natural numbers x and y, let (x,y) denote the Greatest common divisor of x and y. How many pairs of natural numbers x and y
with x <= y satisfy the equation xy = x + y + (x,y)?

This appeared in preRMO 2014.

Solution:

The presence of the GCD component makes it menacing as there could be lot of possibilities.

Lets first try x = y

x^2 = 2x + (x,x)
==> x^2-3x = 0
==> x[x-3] = 0
Rejecting x = 0 as x is a natural number by definition
==> x = 3

Thus (3,3) is one solution

For x < y
if we take x >= 3
==> 3y <= xy = x + y + (x,y)
But x + y + (x,y) < y + y + y = 3y

So we have a situation where both inequalities are in contradiction with each other.

Hence x < 3 so the only possible values are {1,2}

For x = 1, the equation becomes: 1.y = 1 + y + (1,y) and there is no solution here

For x = 2, 2y = 2 + y + (2,y) we get y - 2 = (2,y)

if y = 3 then LHS = 1 and RHS = (2,3) = 1 so the equation is satisfied.

if y = 4 then LHS = 4-2 = 2 and RHS = (2,4) = 2 so the equation is satisfied.

So (2,3) and (2,4) are also solutions.

The total number of solutions is 3 : (3,3),(2,3) and (2,4)
