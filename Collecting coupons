Coupons in cereal boxes are numbered 1 to 5, and a set of one of each is required for a prize. With one coupon per box, how 
many boxes on the average are required to make a complete set?

Solution for Collecting coupons

We get one of the numbers in the first box. Now the chance of getting a new number from the next box is 4/5. 
The second new number requirew 1/(4/5) = 5/4 boxes. The third new number requires an additional 1/(3/5) = 5/3 ; the fourth 5/2, 
the fifth 5/1
Thus the average number of boxes required is 5(1/5 + 1/4 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1) approx 11.42 

Euler's approximation for harmonic sums :

Euler's approximation for the partial sum of the harmonic series :
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ......+1/n approx log(n) + 1/2n + 0.57721...

The number 0.57721 is known as Euler's constant. 
For n coupons in a set, the average number of boxes is approximately nlog(n) + 0.577n + 1/2
As log(5) = 1.6094 ( approx) , Euler's approximation for n = 5 yields 11.43 very close to 11.42
Normally we omit the term 1/2n in Euler's approximation
