A square sheet of paper ABCD is so folded that B falls on the midpoint M of CD. Prove that the crease will divide BC
in the ration 5:3

This one appeared in PreRMO 2018.

Solution:

Let ABCD be a square with side 'a' units.
Let PQ be the crease formed when the paper ABCD is folded.

Let QC = x

When the paper will be folded along the crease PQ, B must coincide with M
Therefore BQ = QM = a - x
Also since M is the mid point of BC. Then MC = a/2
In T(QCM), MC^2 + QC^2 = QM^2
==> a^2/4 + x^2 = (a-x)^2
==> a^2/4 + x^2 = a^2 + x^2 - 2ax
==> 3a^2/4 = 2ax
==> a/x = 8/3
==> a/x - 1 = 8/3 - 1
==> (a-x)/x = 5/3
Therefore we get BQ:QC = 5:3
Thus the crease will divide BC in the ratio of 5:3
