How many two-digit positive integers n have the property that the sum of N and the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits 
of N is a perfect square?

Appeared in PreRMO 2015

Solution:

Let the unit digit be x and ten's digit be y
So the number is 10y + x and reversing the order we get 10x + y
So the sum = 11(x + y)
For the above number to be a perfect square x + y must be 11 or 11 X 4 etc
But the maximum sum of  x + y can be 18
So x + y = 11
As x and y are single digit numbers x can be from 2 to 9 and hence there are 8 numbers
