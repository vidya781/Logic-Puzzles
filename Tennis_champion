This problem appeared Frederick Mosteller's book Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability.

The goal of this puzzle is to bring out the counter intuitiveness and the calculation aspects of probability problems.

To encourage Elemer's promising tennis career, his father offers him a prize if he wins ( atleast ) two matches in a row
in a three match series to be played alternatively with his father and the club champion.It is known that the club champion
is a better player than the father. So what strategy should Elmer choose ? Father-Champion-Father or Champion-Father-Champion?

Solution:

Since Elmer has a better chance of winning against his father rather than the club champion given the known facts, it would 
seem he must choose the first strategy : that is Father-Champion-Father ( F-C-F) instead of C-F-C.

But let the calculations tell the story :

Set with.   F.       C.      F.     Prob                    C.       F.       C.      Prob
            W.       W.      W      f c f                   W.       W.       W.       c f c
            W.       W.      L.     f c (1-f)               W.       W.       L        c f (1 - c)
            L        W.      W.     (1-f)c f                L        W        W.       (1-c)f c
            
   Totals                          f c (2-f)  [P1]                                     f c (2-c). [P2]
   
   Where W = winning a match, L = losing a match
   f = probability of winning against father
   c = probability of winning against champion
   
   On comparing the two strategies, we know that f > c from the given facts for Elmer, so the term in bracket for the 1st
   strategy is less than the one in the second case with the result that in overall probability , P2 > P1 
   
   Lets take an example with numbers: if f = 0.5 and c = 0.3
   P1 = 0.5 X 0.3 X ( 2 - 0.5) = 0.225
   
   While P2 = 0.5 X 0.3 X ( 2 - 0.3) = 0.255
   
   Thus it is clear that the importance of winning the middle match outweighs the disadvantage of playing the club champion twice.
