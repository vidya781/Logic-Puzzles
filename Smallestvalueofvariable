For a natural number b, let N(b) denote the number of natural numbers a for which the equation x^2 + ax + b = 0 has integer roots.
What is the smallest value of b for which N(b) = 20?

This appeared in pre RMO 2014.

Solution:

Sum of the roots = -a, Product of roots = b

As a is a natural, we will consider only integer roots which are divisors of b.

If b is a perfect square, then there will be an odd number divisor and even number of divisors if it is not.

When, number of divisors d is odd, possible values of a, N(b) = ( d + 1)/2

And, when d is even, possible values of a, N(b) = d/2

Given N(b) = 20, therefore d is 39 or 40

Now, we know that the number of divisors for a number with prime factor factorization, 2^p3^q5^r.... is (p+1)(q+1)(r+1)....

Let's now see all cases with as small factors as possible and as small powers as possible.

For d = 39, the possible numbes with 39 divisors are 2^38,2^12.3^2

For d = 40, the possible numbers with 40 divisors are 2^39,2^19.3,2^9.3^3,2^9.3.5,2^4.3^3.5,2^4.3.5.7

Of all the above numbers, the least is teh last term 1680 which is the number we wanted.
