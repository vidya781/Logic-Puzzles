An alphametics puzzle with simple equations which appeared in an RMO.

R, M and O are whole numbers

RMO = 240
RO + M = 46
R + MO = 64

We have to take one of several approaches to solve this.

Treat RO as a joint entity and formulate the quadratic mainly because the second equations provides a clue.

RO(M) = 240
RO[46-RO] = 240

This furthermore tells us that the product of 2 whole numbers R and O must be less than 46.

Solving for RO yields [46 +- sqrt(46*46-2*240)]/2 and this on solving gives 40 and 6

Now there are some possibilities:
 R       O
 4       10
 10       4
 8        5
 5        8
 2        20
 20       2  etc
 
 2        3
 3        2
 1         6
 6         1  etc
 
 Take the first value from this table and see if it satisfies the third equation
 R + MO = 64
 4 + 10 * 6 = 64 The answer yields readily
 So we can conclude that R = 4, O = 10 and M = 6
 
 The trick in these alphametics questions is to quickly spot possibilities and eliminate absurd possibilities by mental 
 inspection.
 In this case we could also have proceeded to factoring 240 on but that would have been a slighty cumberson approach as 
 we would have to deal with possibilities for 3 numbers instead of two as in RO which places a restriction on the allowed 
 values that R and O could take.
 Hence the quadratic approach was quicker in my opinion.
 
 These alphametics type problems are also used in Cryptography to code and decode messages.
