This one appeared in a PreRMO. The question basically asks to find the number of pairs of positive integers (x,y) that is
x + 3y = 100?

Solution:

x + 3y = 100
Therefore x = 100 - 3y
If y = 33, x = 1
   y = 32 , x = 4 and so on
   so the pairs can be represented as (1,33)
                                      (4,32)
                                      ...
                                      (97,1)
  counting the pairs thus, the number of (x,y) pairs is thus 33.
