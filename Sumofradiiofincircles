Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with < DAB = < BDC = 90 degrees. Let the incircles of triangles ABD and BCD touch BD at P and Q
,respectively, with P lying in between B and Q. If AD = 999 and PQ = 200 then what is the sum of the radii of the incircles of the
triangles ABD and BDC?

This appeared in a preRMO .

Solution:

As usual, a diagram is very instructive. Assume that the incircle of ABD touches AD at E and the inradius of ABD and BCD be r1 and r2.
Thus, AE = r1 and DE = AD - AE = 999 - r1
Also Triangle DEO congruent to traingle DPO (as OD is common side and PO = OE)
Therefore DE = DP
Also, DQ = r2 = DP - PQ = DE - 200 = 999 - r1 - 200 = 799 - r1
==> r2 = 799 - r1
==> r2 + r1 = 799

Thus,the sum of the radii of the incircles of triangles ABD and BDC = 799
