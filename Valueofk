The equations x^2 -4x + k = 0 and x^2 + kx - 4 = 0, where k is a real number, have exactly one common root. What is the value of k?

Appeared in a PreRMO 2015

Solution:

Subtracting the two equations, we get (k+4)x - (k+4) = 0
==> (k+4)[x -1] = 0
==> Either k = -4 or x = 1
k = -4 gives both equations identical and hence ruled out, so x must be equal to 1
(1)^2 -4(1) + k = 0
==> k = 3

So the value of k is 3
