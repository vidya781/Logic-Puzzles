In a common carnival game a player tosses a penny from a distance of about 5 feet onto the surface of a table ruled in 1-inch
squares. If the penny ( 3/4 inch in diameter) falls entirely inside a square, the player receives 5 cents but does not get his
penny back; otherwise he loses his penny. If the penny lands on the table, what is the probability that he will win?

Solution

We need consider only the cases when the coin stays on the table, cause if it falls from the table and lands on the ground, 
obviously the probability is zero.

Clearly , it seems to be a case of geometrical probability where probability is directly related to areas. So an analysis of 
what areas constitute the probability use cases. Mandatory condition is that the coin must land entirely inside the square.
This means that the arc of the circle ( coin ) cannot intersect the side of any individual square. For now, the focus is only
a single square region and a single circle (coin) with possibilities of intersection, touching and containment of the circle
within the square.

Of course some positions for the center of the coin are more likely than the others, but over a small square, one can regard the 
probability distribution as uniform. What this means is that the probability that the center falls into any region of a square 
is proportional to the area of the region, indeed, is the area of the region divided by the area of the square. 

Picture this: The coin and the square in perfect symnmetry. The centres of both these figures coincide. Let O be the centre.
Let AB be the horizontal axis and let A'B' be the vertical axis passing through O in the centre. This is a clear win. 

The region segment towards the left of the coin = the region segment towards the right side of the coin = 1/2 - 3/8 = 1/8

Combine these two extreme segments into one = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4 , and consider a square of side 1/4. This is one fourth of the
original square . If the player is to win, the center must not land within 3/8 inch of any edge. We can imagine a small square
enclosing the centre O whose side is s = 1/4 and the area is s^2 = 1/16 The centre O is at liberty to move around in this 
region if the player is to win. 

The probability of winning can be reduced if the lines of the square are thickened. If the lines are 1/16 inch wide, the winning
central area reduces the probability to (3/16)^2 = 9/256
