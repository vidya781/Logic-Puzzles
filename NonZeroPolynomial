Let P(x) be a non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients.If P(n) is divisible by n for each positive integer n, what is the 
value of P(0)?

Appeared in pre RMO 2015

Solution:

By Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,

P(n) - P(m) is divisible by n-m
So P(n) - P(0) is divisble by n
As P(n) is divisible by n for every positive integer n, so P(0) is also divisible by n for all n
So P(0) = 0

This problem illustrates a standard application of the fundamental theorem of Algebra
