A drawer contains red socks and black socks. When two socks are drawn at random, the probability that both are red is 1/2.
a) How small can the number of socks in the drawer be?
b) How small if the number of black socks is even?

Solution :

If conjecture that the number of socks must initially be at least 3 for in this case we can have 2 red socks and 1 black sock
and definitely we rule out the minimum number as two as if both are red, the probability would be one and there is no black
sock at all which is not what the problem states.

More formally, if we set x as the number of red socks and y the number of black socks, we must have the following:

P( both socks are red) = x
                           C
                             2
                        -------   = 1/2 ( from the problem statement)
                         x+y
                            C
                              2
                              
                  => (x + y)(x + y - 1) = 2x(x-1)
                  and noting that the RHS is even, the term on LHS must also be even.
  if x+y = 2p, x+y-1 is odd
  if x+y = 2 ( for p = 1)
  then x + y - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
  But this would mean x = 1, y = 1 that is one black sock and one red sock which is not possible as both socks drawn are red
  
  if x + y = 3, x+y-1 = 2 so that LHS = 6 but RHS = 4 , so the equation does hold good in this case
  
  So we increase y by 1 and see what we get : x = 2, y = 2
  LHS = 12 and RHS = 12 as well , therefore if x = 3 and y = 1 the equation is clearly satisfied.
  Then x + y = total number of socks = 4
  Hence in probability type problems as these, intuition must always be justified with the supporting calculations that corroborates
  or contradicts the intuition.
  
  To tackle the second aspect of the problem, y = 2p ( given)
  (x+y)(x+y-1) = 2x(x-1)
  (x+2p)(x+2p-1) = 2x(x-1)
  2p[2(x+p)-1] = x(x-1) and treating it algebraically, we have
  2p is even clearly for any p, therefore either x or x-1 should be of the form 2k to get an even number on LHS.
  In the previous case, we had x = 3, y = 1
  Suppose we have y = 4, p = 2 as y = 2p
  4[2(x+2)-1] = x(x-1),=> 4[2x + 3] = x(x-1)
  => 8x + 12 = x^2-x and on solving we find x is not an integer. In particular we must have that the discriminant should 
  be a perfect square.
  Moving on, we try y = 6 so p = 3 , 2 x 3[2(x+3)-1] = x(x-1) 
  6[2x + 5] = x^2 - x, => x^2 - 13x-30 = 0 and D = 289 so it is a perfect square, therefore solving for x yields x = 15 
  ( as we reject the negative value) and so y = 6 , so total number of socks = x + y = 15 + 6 = 21
  
  Inequality method : ( Mosteller's method)
  
  Lets do a numerical example first: If there are 5 red and 2 black socks, then probability of the first sock being red 
  would be 5/(5+2) . If the first were red, the probability of the second being red would be 4/(4+2)as one red sock had 
  already been removed.
  Product of these = 5/(5+2) X 4/(4+2) = 10/21 which is NOT exactly half.
  So deep dive algebraically:
  Let there be r red and b black socks.Probability of the first sock being red = r/(r+b) and the probability that the second
  sock being red now that the first sock has been removed = (r-1)/(r+b-1) 
  So r/(r+b)X (r-1)/(r+b-1) = 1/2
  One could just start with b = 1 and try successive values of r and then go on to b = 2 and try again and so on but lets 
  try some juggling :
  r/(r + b) > (r-1)/(r+b-1) for b > 0
  (r/r+b)^2 > 1/2 > (r-1/r+b-1)^2
  Taking square roots, we have for r > 1
  r/(r+b) > 1/sqrt(2) > r-1/(r+b-1)
  From the first inequality we get r > 1/sqrt(2). (r+ b) ( on the numerator)
  or r > 1/sqrt(2)-1 . b = (sqrt(2) + 1)b
  From the second we get, (sqrt(2) + 1)b > r-1
  (sqrt(2) + 1)b + 1 > r > (sqrt(2) + 1)b
  For b = 1, r must be > 2.414 and < 3.414 and so the candidate is r = 3.
  For r = 3, b = 1 we get P(2 red socks) = 3/4. 2/3 = 1/2 
  So the smallest number of socks is 4
  Beyond this we look at even values of b
  
  b         r is between.      eligible r    P(2 red socks)
  ----      -------------       ---------    -------------
  2.         5.8, 4.8             5           5(4)/7(6) not equal to 1/2
  
  4.         10.7, 9.7.           10          10(9)/14(13) not equal to 1/2
  
  6.         15.5, 14.5.          15.         15(14)/21(20) = 1/2
  
  And so 21 socks is the smallest number when b is even.
  If we were to go on and ask for further values of r and b so that the probability of
  two red socks is 1/2, we would be wise to appreciate that this is a problem in the theory of numbers.
  It happens to lead to a famous result in Diophantine Analysis obtained from Pell's equation. 
  As a passing example, try r = 85, b = 35
