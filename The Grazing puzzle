A cow, a goat and a rabbit graze in a field. The grass in the field grows at a uniform rate. It is known that the cow eats as much as the goat 
and the rabbit together eat. The cow and the goat ( without the rabbit) can eat all the grass in the field in 45 days, the cow and the 
rabbit in 60 days and the goat and the rabbit in 90 days. In how many days can all three animals together eat all the grass in the field?

Solution:

This may seem like a trivial puzzle but in reality its not. We proceed to give eating rates for each of the three animals
namely Cow: c m^2/day, Goat: g m^2/day and rabbit: r m^2/day and let A be the area of the field.

We quickly formulate the equations to get:

A/c + A/g = 45
A(1/c + 1/g) = 45 -----[1]

A(1/c + 1/r) = 60 -----[2]

A(1/g + 1/r) = 90 -----[3]

Adding all the 3 we get A[1/c + 1/g + 1/r] = 195/2 = 97.5 

However we know this answer is wrong as common sense tells us that all three animals eating together must finish off the grass 
in the field sooner than 45 days which is the number of days the cow and goat take (without the rabbit) in order to finish the
grass in the field.

We are however yet to take advantage of the facts in the problem:
1] The grass in the field grows at a uniform field
2] Cow eats as musch as the goat and rabbit together eat. 

Mathematically, c = g + r ( where each of the variables are noted for rate of eating of the respective animals)

45 days = 1 cow + 1 goat
        = 1 goat + 1 rabbit + 1 goat
        = 2 goat + 1 rabbit
        
Also,

90 days = 1 goat + 1 rabbit

We can temporarily ignore the rabbit in the above set of equations and confirm that 1 goat will take 90 days to finish the 
field (while the rabbit grazes on the grass growing at a uniform rate. 
Certainly there is some contribution by the rabbit but its capacity is limited.

Let G be the original amount of grass which the goat takes 90 days to eat.
From this logic, the cow will take 60 days to complete the field by itself.

Hence it can be concluded that 1 rabbit can eat the daily grass growth, cow eats 1/60 of G and the goat eats 1/90 of G.
The cow and the goat together eat (1/60 + 1/90) = 1/36 of G while the rabbit consumes the daily grass growth. 
So all three animals eating the grass together will take 36 days to complete the field.
